            "description": "I became inspired to make this drawing while looking at the ancient Egyptian grid systems employed to represent social hierarchy via a pharaoh\u2019s idealism. The system I invented to generate the colors of the grid was based on the size of the language used in various texts \u2013 the lengths of words, sentences and paragraphs. It became an indecipherable code. I began the drawing by randomly scribbling across the paper. I then marked the intersection points of the lines and connected them to create the dominant shape in the work. Next, I drew the grid across the entire form and began to apply the system. The system linked the sizes of words, sentences and paragraphs to corresponding colors. For example, if a word was 5 letters in length, it would be red. If it was 10 letters long, it would be silver. The lengths of the sentences are also encoded this way. The sizes of the paragraphs are marked with alternating orange and violet pairs of squares. Finally, a change in text is marked by 4 fluorescent squares. I chose a wide range of texts to encode. I began with the Atkins\u2019 Diet and included works such as Chaos, Declaration of Independence, Bible Code, Dante\u2019s Inferno, How to Build a Time Machine, Rethinking Intuition, The Da Vinci Code and numerous others. The title of each text is written in proximity to its pattern on the grid. Lastly, the color of the larger areas along with the grey central section were determined through chance.",

I then recorded the points on my body (with a Sharpie) where I felt an itch and then transcribed them to the paper, which was cut to my exact height. The orientation of the \u201cX marks\u201d correspond to the parts of my body (i.e. an X slanted to the right equals an itch on my back, etc.). After noting all the points, I tried to look for and demarcate a pattern.

            "description": "I was inspired to make this drawing by the theories of the German 19th century scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus. He quantified transience. His theory was that memory of random or impersonal \"things\" fades over time at predictable rates. I decided to test this theory on myself, visually. In the drawing, I began with an all-over, numbered grid. Using sets of lottery numbers applied to the grid, I created an initial shape. I then tried to test my memory of this chance-derived form. To do this, I stood at arms\u2019 length, closed my eyes, and attempted to redraw the shape, section by section. This process eventually resulted in the final, more complex form. The patterns and information included in and around the form reflect the history of the drawing in addition to my conceptual and aesthetic decision-making.",

I began by recording when, where, and at what ambient temperature an itch developed on my head. Then, I marked the actual location of the itch on my head with a marker, and transcribed the location point onto paper. The paper was divided into quadrants corresponding to the front, back, top, left and right areas of my head. The notations are in letterform and were derived from the temperature I recorded at each itch (i.e. 81.2\u00b0 equals 8+1+2, or 11, or the letter K). Next, I connected all the letters into the centralized form and attempted to delineate the pattern of my itching, which was concentrated on my face. Additionally, the small, satellite-like forms on the perimeter are the various times of the itches in each quadrant, overlapped.",

            "description": "The potential relationship between state percentages of obese and overweight adults, binge drinkers, and the overall safety rating for each state in the US was the impetus for this drawing. I began by recording and marking the ranking for states in each category according to 2002/03 statistics. The ovals reflect each state\u2019s numerical ranking. In addition, I invented a distinct method to record state percentages in each category in terms of size and color. The \u201cstripes\u201d for the safest state rankings at the top correspond to the number and size (eventual length) of ovals initially recorded for each. After recording and transforming this data, I looked for various visual and conceptual connections. The shape in the center is an altered representation of the top state in each category (MN, MI, LA, MS). I formed this by connecting all four states on a map in the most efficient way possible. Throughout the drawing, I outlined shapes to demarcate the inner spaces between forms \u2013 these are denoted by the thin white looping lines and are a type of pattern mapping. I also incorporated information relating to pertinent process at work in these emergent systems, such as swarm logic and the human nervous system. To this extent, I attempted to connect the human body and insect colony formations with obesity, binge drinking, and the relative safety of each US State.",

            "description": "\t In making this work I attempted to explore the nuances of balance and separation as manifested in borderlines \u2013 manmade and self-forming. The central, structural lines of the drawing resulted from my random application of the borderlines between the US and Canada, and the US and Mexico. I initially made stencils from a small map and applied the resulting borderlines to the paper based on a system I invented, which was based on various sets of winning NY lottery numbers and originated in the center. If the lottery number was even, I applied the Canada/US border stencil. If it was odd, then I applied the Mexico/US border. The direction of the lines, ranging from North, South, East, West and all combinations in between, was also dictated by the given lottery number. Each line connected to the other, creating a complex, looping web of intricate contours. After I created this set of lines, I delineated the central island-like form. Within that island, I isolated another more 3-dimensional form/shape and colored its state-like sections with cool and warm colors. The black and white lower section of the drawing was my attempt to organize, through geometric repetition, the sprawling borderline combinations. The upper dome-like portion of the drawing contains a wide range of information relating to historical hierarchies and mythologies: Greek and Roman gods, the plagues of Egypt, prophecies of Nostradamus, and various conceptions of heaven and hell. In the central, shaded portion, the organic shape originated in an Oliver Sacks article on balance. I hand-copied two portions of his text in opposite directions and outlined the shapes in between the words. Other pieces of information are spread throughout the drawing and reflect my thought processes, information gathering, and aesthetic trials.",

            "description": "Over the past several years, I have been recording my daily weight fluctuations. Before beginning this work, I consolidated these recordings in order to eliminate repeat weights. In the drawing, I derived the size of the central circle by averaging my weight for the past 4 years and subtracting the result from my ideal weight (according to the Department of Health). Then, I added up all of the single-digit, common numbers from my weight chart and came up with 42, represented by the finger-like extensions emanating from the circle. The next level of solidly colored leaf-like shapes resulted from another interpretation of my weight changes. Emanating from the concave sections of the red form, the length of each \u201cleaf\u201d equals a specific physical weight multiplied and then divided by others, translated into centimeters. I multiplied or divided according to whether the weight was even or odd / small or large. The colors (cool or warm) also corresponded to those number qualities. The next structural section growing from these leaf-like forms came about after I translated my weights into letters and then into words, via a pocket dictionary. Then, I re-translated the new words back into numbers and plotted them as tentacle-like, looping extensions. Some of the information within these and the other spaces was derived from the following: references to state statistics of obesity and binge drinking; the exact middle sections of anatomy books (diagrams from these pages); the negative spaces in between the circulatory and vascular system; baldness progression diagrams; every word in the thesaurus for fat, with the middle letter removed. The black and white central snowflake shape was the final piece of the drawing. I made it by tracing and then overlapping the negative spaces of various paintings and sculptures from Greek and Renaissance history, such as the Spear Bearer and Michelangelo\u2019s Moses. Lastly, interspersed throughout the work is information pertaining to the systems and processes in the drawing.",

            "description": "A Nostradamus prophecy predicting religious turmoil and wars was the foundation of this drawing. I began by translating three manifestations of the prophecy \u2013 the original French version, the English translation and the editor\u2019s summary \u2013 into inches and centimeters. Emanating from the upper center, I plotted each letter of the original text in inches (A=1 inch, B=2 inches, etc.). I then translated the English version\u2019s letters into inches and connected them to the original lines, at different angles. Finally, I connected the editor\u2019s summary. The overlapping lines created a dominant inner shape, which I reinforced with solid graphite and grey colored pencil. Several lines extended outward from the perimeter of this form, which I capped with circles and filled with patterns derived from their distances from the perimeter. In the lower section of the drawing, there are other textual references to the prophecy. I counted the number of letters in each word of Nostradamus\u2019s original writing, and chose an equivalent amount of random numbers (1 to 26). For example, if Nostradamus\u2019s original written word had 3 letters, I then chose 3 random numbers from 1 to 26. I then re-translated these numbers back into letters and entered the random configurations into my pocket dictionary, which searched for the closest English approximation. The resulting words are interspersed throughout portions of the drawing. I also included the punctuation of the Nostradamus text, and a portion of his original writing appears outside the yellow bands, written in cursive.",

I spun around 31 times (my age) and then tried to draw 2 distinct, evenly spaced spirals (symbols of hypnosis): one circular and the other rectangular. A \u201ccore\u201d emerged at the center-left, outlined in black \u2013 the result of the overlapping of each initial spiral. Within this core, the number of points comprising the central shapes corresponds to different U.S. state statistical averages of obesity and binge drinking. Similarly, throughout the drawing information is transformed and embedded within the initial drawing. I used contrasting formal elements to distinguish between layers of information and to maintain the integrity of the beginning spirals. For example, the number, color and size of various sets of stripes correspond to words and statistics. For this \u201ccoding\u201d I incorporated numerous sources such as Oliver Sacks\u2019s writings on balance, medical texts, lottery numbers, and US statistics relating to human \u201cimbalance.\u201d In addition, I made and employed stencils of the borderlines between the US, Canada and Mexico. I also referenced two identical clocks that I set two years ago simultaneously but which now have greatly divergent times. And the random fragments of residual color remaining on the contours guided the direction of the string-like bands surrounding the main form. Overall, my formal and conceptual interests are integrated into a web of balance and imbalance derived from my dizziness.",

I started with the NY State Lottery and used the last set of 5 winning numbers to generate a new zip code, which then led me to another state.

To form the central shape\u2019s patterns, I created different color-based \u201ccodes\u201d as a way to represent the numbers visually. I changed the color system as the pattern reached the center, creating a strata-like progression in visual complexity \u2013 for the outer layer, each color denotes a specific number, while for the innermost layer, colors only signify even or odd numbers. Simultaneously, I translated these same numbers into words. I set up a text-based encoding system based on the alphabet\u2019s numerical equivalents (a=1, b=2, etc.). As each winning set of numbers generated a random set of letters, I then entered these random letters into a pocket dictionary, which searched for the closest approximated word.

Beginning in the center with Westfield, MA (my hometown), I recorded predicted high and low temperatures for 3 consecutive days. I then compared these forecasts with the actual recorded highs and lows for each day. Using a system I invented, I plotted these numerical temperature differences on the paper \u2013 they are a combination of circles, squares, etc. The system correlated the temperature differences with color (warm colors for warmer actual temps, cool color for cooler temps) and size. My system also connected temperature difference with direction \u2013 3 degrees difference equaled 3 squares to the upper left, 4 degrees equaled 4 ovals to the lower right, etc.). After plotting the temperature differences for each of the 3 days, I used these same numbers to create a new zip code, which led me to another city, where I again recorded 3 days of predicted high and low temperatures and contrasted those with the actual temperatures. This process connected numerous cities in states such as Texas, Ohio, New York, and others. I continued to apply this system until the forms meandered off the paper. These looping lines and shapes created larger, more varied spaces. I measured the inner contours of these spaces and matched them with a list of the top ten natural disasters according to FEMA. The disasters and various related statistics are rendered within each space.",

The words are from a 2005 study reported in the Guardian of the most offensive words in television.

Within these contours, I created patterns and forms that reference images and texts that are both clear and hidden \u2013 messages embedded within images. I thought of this duality as a metaphor for interpersonal interaction, where our impulses are hidden within casual communication, yet our facial and body language reveal complex patterns of thought.",

            "description": "I began this drawing by recording the dates of the ten largest earthquakes and wars in the United States. I also recorded and included other pertinent information such as duration, location, severity, etc. The upper and lower stripes or bars correspond to the dates of the quakes and wars \u2013 the lengths of the stripes equal the dates (i.e. 1994 = 1 inch, 9 inches, etc.). I also developed a system to determine the color of each stripe. After I drew the stripes, I looked for patterns in the actual dates and the space(s) left between the sets of stripes. As with other works, I tried to look for similarities, an interconnectedness \u2013 principles or systems that may guide seemingly disparate phenomena. I tried various ways to create a form that would link the sets of bars and I eventually arrived at the organic central shape. To do this I measured from the end of each bar a distance based on the duration of the wars and the size of the quakes (translated into centimeters), and connected the resulting points. I thought of this process as a phase transition, in which one system is transformed into another. The information I placed throughout the drawing also relates to the conceptual similarities I observed. One concept that each phenomena seemed to have in common was the critical state, a kind of organization characterized by a tendency toward sudden and tumultuous change, one that seems to arise naturally under diverse conditions when a system gets pushed away from equilibrium. Another principle that I thought might determine the frequency of wars and quakes, was the butterfly effect. This effect, in which a simple occurrence can have much greater consequences, is what begins the process culminating in a critical state. I tried to make the central shape resemble the entirety of the butterfly effect, yet in reverse \u2013 it is at once a type of growth system and simultaneously a contained, definable form.",

In doing so, I invented ways of translating many different types of information about the lottery \u2013 social commentary, winning numbers, losing predictions, odds of winning, etc. into forms, shapes and patterns. My process was additive, incremental and inconsistent. The main conceptual / information-based layers of the work, from bottom to top, are: 1. Incorrect predictions of winning lottery numbers, which I translated into words via a simple system (each number corresponded to a letter \u2013 A=1, B=2, etc) 2. Purely random numbers (I translated them into numbers of shapes and patterns, colors, etc.) 3. Representations of religious symbols / crosses \u2013 signs of faith 4. Various written descriptions of the social implications of the lottery as described by various sociologists 5. Actual winning numbers for NY lottery 6. Average percentage chance of winning the lottery I thought of the whole thing as my building / drawing of a very unstable tower of sorts, based on the idea and implications of the lottery as a mechanism of social change.",

Specifically, I used a study from 2004 in the Journal of Social Psychology of Dutch, English, French, Irish, Scottish, Greek, and Italian conceptions of personal space. The study looked at gender, pairs of people, and groups. The literal space was recorded for each group studied, and then averaged. I used these measurements to create the structure and patterns in this work. The length of the lines and sizes of shapes in my drawing correspond to the actual spaces (measured in the study) between people of different cultures. The patterns I made also reference these differences. In the center, I used photographs I took and found of people moving through crowds at parades \u2013 their patterns trying to navigate these spaces.",

            "description": "Conceptually, this work is my attempt to visualize a prediction, by NASA scientists, that an asteroid called Apophis will strike the Earth in 2036. In Egyptian myth, Apophis was the ancient spirit of evil and destruction. The asteroid is 390 meters wide and could release more than 100,000 times the energy of the nuclear blast over Hiroshima. Thousands of square kilometers would be directly affected by the blast but the entire Earth would see the effects of the dust released into the atmosphere. To begin, I made stencils of the shape of the Hiroshima Bomb (before explosion), and the shape of the plume of smoke that resulted from its blast. I drew these stencils in the center of the paper, repeating them 100 times \u2013 in an attempt to connect the totality of the potential Apophis explosion to the Hiroshima bomb. Everything else in the work unfolded from this central shape (the explosion). I used the size of the explosion to determine the sizes and shapes of the outgrowths, or wings unfurling from the center. The word UNFOLD is written, in a now obsolete WW2 military code, on the perimeter of the form. The grey grid is made up of randomly applied grays, increasingly more numerous and darker toward the edges of the paper.",

            "description": "Alan Turing\u2019s test for artificial intelligence \u2013 the Turing Test \u2013 was what inspired me to make this piece. Turing proposed the test in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which opened with the words: \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'\" The test was set up as follows: a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test \u2013 it is intelligent and can think. To start the work, I reversed Turing into Gnirut, playing with the idea of a human acting as a computer, trying to fake the computer into thinking it was talking to one of its own. This also led me to think about the differences between the ideas of predestiny and free will, a religious take on the Turing Test. I began the drawing with the text parts, starting at the top and moving down in two related but distinct columns. In each side, I continually alternated between my own free associations to words and phrases, and then tried to get a \u201cmachine\u2019s\u201d response, which I would then respond to, etc. I did this by deconstructing the text in any way I could think of \u2013 text into numbers, reversing the letters, using a coding system to transform the information. I never knew where this would lead me. One part of the process was particularly intriguing and haunting. The 2 large groups of numbers at the top part of the work (59389537 and 60556158) resulted when I added up each of the previous letters translated into numbers. I then re-translated these sets of totaled numbers into text \u2013 59389537 became EICHICG; and 60556158 became FEEFAEH When I entered these letters into my electronic dictionary, the closest words that it discovered were Giza, and Faggot. I was shocked by the latter in that it seemed like the computer was becoming aware of Alan Turing\u2019s past: Turing was homosexual, and was criminally prosecuted in 1952 \u2014 homosexual acts were illegal in the United Kingdom at that time \u2014 and he accepted treatment with female hormones (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. In a sense, part of his life had to be hidden, or faked, in order for him to be able to do the work he loved. The computer seemed to be conscious of this in some way. Or it was completely random.

His most recent and largest drawing, \u201cDrug Loop,\u201d reveals the circular effect of popular medications and their side effects. He begins at the top with \u201cheadache\u201d and takes as solution, Bayer Aspirin. He then randomly selects from among listed side effects, chooses a new medication to treat the side effect, and so on around a central circular shape-from \u201cno sex drive\u201d to \u201chyperactivity,\u201d \u201canxiety,\u201d and, finally, \u201cagitation.\u201d - Susan Swenson (2011) In the center of the drawing, I began by drawing 2 small brain scans, connected - one of a healthy brain, and one with Alzheimer's disease. I then traced the contour of the 2 brains combined, flipped it, and redrew it around the first images. I continued this process of drawing and re-drawing the contours of each successive form, allowing the shape to grow organically, with small, almost imperceptible changes occurring with each phase. It was as if the specific shape of the original scans began to multiply and mutate, almost fractally, and eventually started to invade the medication ring.",
