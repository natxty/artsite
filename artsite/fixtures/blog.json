For flight in the dense air of the usable atmosphere, the X-15 used conventional aerodynamic controls. For flight in the thin air outside of the appreciable Earth's atmosphere, the X-15 used a reaction control system. Hydrogen peroxide thrust rockets located on the nose of the aircraft provided pitch and yaw control and those on the wings provided roll control.", "author": "Brendan Behan", "sub_content": "A giant explosion on the Sun was captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory on November 16th, 2012.
